# CarSimTest
A game about cars moving around. Look in the releases folder for downloads (windows only). Simply unzip the folder and run the executable.

The final game will contain:
* Player-built road network consisting of intantly placable modules
* Different types of vehicles with different needs: regular cars, taxis, busses, trucks and emergency vehicles
* Custom road modules
* A pathfinder that respects current traffic conditions
* Programmable traffic lights

## v0.6
The build window has arrived!
* Use b to open the build window
* Build straight roads by clicking on the world with the build window open
* Use 1, 2 and 3 to toggle visibility options and see your new roads

## v0.5
Windows! Add new viewports with v and remove the topmost window with backspace.

## v0.4
The graphics system has been reworked to allow scrolling of the world and to allow bigger vehicles with multiple textures. This makes it possible to have a much larger world and maybe even trains.

## v0.3
* Cars have a new texture and rotate properly
* Custom infrastructure modules can be loaded from a text file. Still needs a lot of improvements...
* Cars no longer have to slow down to move from one module to another

## v0.2
Infrastructure modules have arrived! Cars will simply follow their predefined paths and jump onto the next module at the end.

## v0.1
Cars move around on a world made of tiles. Traffic lights automatically block tiles at regular intervals.
